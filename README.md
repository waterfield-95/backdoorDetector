# backdoorDetector
Lab2 ML for cybersecurity

## How to run my code
At backdoor_detector.ipynb, you just need to specify the path of data directory and model directory in the 5th cell.
You can get data and bad model from https://github.com/csaw-hackml/CSAW-HackML-2020/tree/master/lab3#ii-data

Once you download data, you can run all the cells to get final result. (p.s, new generated model would be saved in the model directory you declared before)
